# CitiBike_Tableau

# Overview of the Citi Bike
The main objectives of this project are to visualize the following information using “citibike tripdata”:
1)	The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2)	The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
3)	The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
To do so, we need to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype using python (i.e., pandas).

# Results:
## Deliverable 1
 

## Deliverable 2
•	There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.

## Deliverable 3
This figure displays the customer’s breakdown based on their genders and types. It reveals that male is the dominant gender in bike customer.

The peak hour for bike users are 7-9 am and 5-7 pm on weekdays, whereas the weekends peak hour starts from 10 am and continues 7 pm.

Additionally, we can see the downtown core is the major place for bike sharing.

# Summary:
1)	Men are the major customers, and also prefer subscriptions.
2)	The peak hours on weekdays are the morning commute to the workplace and the evening time to return back.
3)	The trend is the opposite on weekends (all day but not those office hours) with a little busy.
Recommendations:
1)	To attract women riders, some bikes should be women-friendly.
2)	To increase the number of weekend riders, some weekend events can be sponsored. Importantly, those events should be arranged somewhere biking would be necessary. 
Visualization ideas:
1)	A Visualization is to see where the people are not using the services.
2)	A monthly analysis to have a better idea of seasonality.
